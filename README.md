# Customer_Churn_Prediction
 # Overview
--Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

--Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the customer itself.

--Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

# Objectives:
--Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.

--Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn

--Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.
